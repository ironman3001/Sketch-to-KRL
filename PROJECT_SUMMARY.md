# Sketch-to-KRL Code Generator - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Sketch-to-KRL Code Generator is a Python-based web application that allows users to convert sketches of robot paths into KUKA Robot Language (KRL) code. This tool bridges the gap between visual design and robot programming, making it easier for users to create robot motion paths without extensive programming knowledge.

## Key Features

1. **Dual Input Methods**:
   - Upload PNG/JPG sketches
   - Draw paths directly in the browser canvas

2. **Advanced Path Processing**:
   - Edge detection using OpenCV
   - Path extraction and simplification
   - Coordinate mapping for robot workspace

3. **Interactive Configuration**:
   - Start position selection (HOME or custom)
   - Multiple motion types (LIN, PTP, CIRC, SPLINE)
   - Path smoothing and simplification options

4. **KRL Code Generation**:
   - Structured .src program files
   - Coordinate-based .dat files
   - Support for multiple motion types in one program

5. **Visualization and Output**:
   - 2D path visualization with motion type indicators
   - Path overlay on original sketch
   - Downloadable KRL code files

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **OpenCV** and **NumPy** for image processing
- **Matplotlib** for path visualization
- **Pillow** for canvas drawing
- **scikit-image** for advanced image processing

The modular architecture separates concerns into:
- Sketch input handling
- Path extraction
- KRL code generation
- Visualization
- File handling

## Deployment Options

The application supports multiple deployment methods:
1. **Local installation** via pip and Streamlit
2. **Google Colab** using the provided notebook
3. **Hugging Face Spaces** for public access

## Use Cases

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly convert design sketches to robot paths
2. **Education**: Teaching robot programming concepts visually
3. **Path Planning**: Planning complex robot movements without manual coding
4. **WAAM Applications**: Supporting Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing paths

## Future Enhancements

1. **3D Path Support**: Extract and visualize 3D paths
2. **Advanced Path Smoothing**: Implement better path optimization
3. **Direct Robot Integration**: Connect directly to KUKA robot controllers
4. **Additional File Formats**: Support for STL/DXF input
5. **Real-time Simulation**: Preview robot movements in 3D

## Conclusion

The Sketch-to-KRL Code Generator demonstrates how computer vision and web technologies can simplify industrial robot programming. By providing an intuitive visual interface for creating robot paths, it makes robot programming more accessible to users without extensive coding experience.

The modular design allows for easy extension and enhancement, while multiple deployment options ensure flexibility for different use cases.
